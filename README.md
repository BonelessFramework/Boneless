[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benhinchley/Boneless.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/benhinchley/Boneless)

Boneless is a community driven front-end framework, written in  [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) that takes it's roots from [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) [Skeleton Framework](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton). In Boneless there is no set direction of what it has to be, or where it has to go. Boneless is whatever the collective community wants it to be.
