Boneless is a community driven front-end framework, written in  [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) that takes it's roots from [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) [Skeleton Framework](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton). In Boneless there is no set direction of what it has to be, or where it has to go. Boneless is whatever the collective community wants it to be.

**Potential direction for Boneless**
 * Improve the current state of Skeleton by addressing it's [current issues](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/issues)
 * Enhance the current capabilities of Skeleton
 * Expand it to a full UI framework
 * Make Boneless the fastest front-end framework
 * Make Boneless the largest community driven front-end framework.
